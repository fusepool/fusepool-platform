fusepool-platform
=================

The fusepool platform contains all fusepool developed components as submodules. As soon as this repository
gets a commit the platform is build through Jenkins.

To get the source do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/fusepool/fusepool-platform.git
    cd fusepool-platform
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To compile the fusepool platform and its modules you need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
version 3 or newer installed.

On many systems to should set an environment variable for maven to be executed with enough memory:

    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M"

Compile with

    mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Of course, omitt -Dmaven.test.skip=true if you want to run the tests as well

To run it change to launcher/target 

    cd launcher/target

and run it with

    java -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=400M -Xss512k -jar launcher-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

To start it in debug mode so that you can connect a debuger on port 8888

    java -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=400M -Xss512k -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=n -jar launcher-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 

Updating
========

Update fusepool-platform:

    git pull
    
Update all submodules:

    git submodule update --remote

Adding new Submodules
=====================
A few notes on adding new modules to the platform:

- The submodule should be added by their https (not git-uri so that people without edit right can still check out the platform)
  e.g. git submodule add https://github.com/fusepool/fusepool-something.git
- Add the submodule to the reactor, i.e. to the pom.xml in fusepool-platform
- Add the module's as a dependency to the bundlelist submodule, as for any submodule change make sure you checkout the master branch, commit and push it and the also commit and push the submodule in the containing project.  
 
On the shell this looks like:

    cd bundlelist
    edit pom.xml
    git commit -m "added foobar" pom.xml
    git push
    cd ..
    git commit -m "updated bundlelist module" bundlelist
    git push
